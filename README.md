# Simple Chatbot using PyTorch

This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the implementation of a simple chatbot using PyTorch, RNN, LSTM, and Transformers.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
- `data/`: Contains sample data for the chatbot.
- `models/`: Stores trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Optional directory for Jupyter notebooks and experimentation.

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the chatbot with `python src/main.py`.

## Features

- Basic chatbot functionality with RNN and LSTM.
- Transformer-based model for improved performance.
- Easy to understand and modify for learning purposes.
